### Facts after resarched more in detail

- **VSCode link generation with auto complete**  
    - The link style (slug) seems to be equal to how GitHub does (✅ good)  
    - BUT the Variation Selector-16 part (U+FE0F – like in ✔️) is not removed for auto complete link generation: The variation selector part (UTF-8: `EF B8 8F`) is being put into the link text (invisible for the consumer in VSCode) and then later in GitHub renderer into the links (e.g. `<a href="#%EF%B8%8F-header9">Link to Header9</a>`). That's why those links won't work (❌ not good)

- **VSCode Preview**  
    - There is also an issue in the renderer since neither the [manually created links](#this-should-have-been-created) (that all work in GitHub), nor the [auto completed links](#this-is-generated-by-vscode-autocomplete) work (not good ❌)

> ℹ️ If you get the autocomplete to create all the links (1–12) like in '[This should have been created](#this-should-have-been-created)' and the VSCode preview to make the links work, this issue should be resolved ☺️

### This should have been created 

If links would be create like this, they would be work in GitHub, if you put this whole comment as markdown into a separate `*.md` file.

[Link to Header1](#header1-)  
[Link to Header2](#header2)  
[Link to Header3](#-header3)  
[Link to Header4](#header4)  
[Link to Header5](#header5)  
[Link to Header6](#header-6)

[Link to Header7](#header7-)  
[Link to Header8](#header8)  
[Link to Header9](#-header9)  
[Link to Header10](#header10)  
[Link to Header11](#header11)  
[Link to Header12](#header-12)  

### This IS generated by VSCode autocomplete

These are the links create by VSCode autocomplete. Looks as same as above but here invisible Variation Selector-16 `U+FE0F` characters are contained for links 7-12 because of ✔️) so only 1-6 work in GitHub.

### Test-Header

**Testing different headers types**  

- Symbol at the end with leading empty character
- Symbol at the end without leading empty character
- Symbol at the beginning followed by an empty character
- Symbol at the beginning without following empty character
- Symbol at the middle without leading empty character
- Symbol at the middle with leading empty character

**For each type testing symbols**  

1. 🔥 (`U+1F525`)
2. ✔️ (contains Variation Selector-16 → `U+2714 + U+FE0F`)
