### Facts after resarched more in detail

In summary: Only the HTML preview needs to be fixed:

- **VSCode link generation with auto complete**  
    - The link style (slug) seems to be equal to how GitHub does (✅ good)  
    - The Variation Selector-16 part of some unicode symbols (U+FE0F - like in ✔️) is not removed for auto complete link generation: This part (e.g. UTF-8: `EF B8 8F`) is put into the markdown link text (invisible character for the consumer). I first thought this would be wrong but depending on the renderer this is ok: Aligned to GitHub this invisible character needs to be kept, since GitHub's renderer creates  
        - An HTML header whose id attribute contains this character  
        - A link like e.g. `<a href="#header7-%EF%B8%8F">Link to Header7</a>` that also assumes this invisible character to be available.  
        So according to GitHub this is also ✅ good and should not be changed

- **VSCode Preview**  
    - This is the part where the issue lies I think. Seems that in the generated HTML for the preview either the links and/or the header (`<hX>`) do not consider the hidden characters like the GitHub renderer does. (not good ❌)  
    - VSCode's preview should work with the links its own autocomplete creates:  
        - Put the characters of the link in the HTML header `id` tags  
        - Put the characters of the link in the HTML `href` attributes accordingly

### Links generated by VSCode autocomplete

- These are the links created by VSCode autocomplete  
- None of them work in VSCode Preview  
- All of them work if this comment is put as markdown into a separate `.md` file on GitHub.  
- Links 7–12 contain invisible Variation Selector-16 `U+FE0F` characters because of ✔️.

### Test-Header

**Testing different headers types**  

- Symbol at the end with leading empty character
- Symbol at the end without leading empty character
- Symbol at the beginning followed by an empty character
- Symbol at the beginning without following empty character
- Symbol at the middle without leading empty character
- Symbol at the middle with leading empty character

**For each type testing symbols**  

1. 🔥 (`U+1F525`)
2. ✔️ (contains Variation Selector-16 → `U+2714 + U+FE0F`)
